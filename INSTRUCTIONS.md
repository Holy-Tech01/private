# How to Run HOD Sport

This application is built with **React** and **Vite**. It requires **Node.js** to run.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install Node.js**:
    *   The command `npm` was not found on your system.
    *   Download and install the latest "LTS" (Long Term Support) version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    *   During installation, ensure the option to "Add to PATH" is selected.
    *   After installation, restart your terminal/command prompt to verify:
        ```bash
        node --version
        npm --version
        ```

## Steps to Run

1.  **Open a terminal** in the project folder: `c:\xampp\htdocs\HOD Sport`
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **View the app**:
    *   The terminal will show a URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).
    *   Open that URL in your web browser.

## Build for Production (Optional)

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
Then preview it:
```bash
npm run preview
```
